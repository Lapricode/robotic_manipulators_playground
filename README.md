# robotic_manipulators_playground

<div style="text-align: justify;">

This is a python tkinter GUI for designing, simulating and controlling robotic manipulators, that also gives a solution to the obstacles avoidance problem.

The program can be run both in windows and linux.

You may need to calibrate your own camera, if you want to play with the related program features. In order to do that you need to capture new images with your camera and put them inside the "camera_calibration_images" folder.

There is a problem with the swift library that may have been solved by now, or not. The issue has been identified in the robotics-toolbox-python repository on GitHub: https://github.com/petercorke/robotics-toolbox-python/issues/383. The problem arises when running the swift library on Windows. Specifically, there is a discrepancy in how file paths are handled between Linux and Windows systems. The root of the issue lies in how the self.path variable is processed within the SwiftRoute.py file. The current implementation attempts to adjust the path by retaining the initial / character, which works fine on Linux but leads to incorrect path formatting on Windows. To address the problem on Windows, a simple adjustment can be made in the SwiftRoute.py file of the swift library. Specifically, update the block of code by modifying self.path[9:] to self.path[10:].

So, for linux it must be like this:
```python
elif self.path.startswith("/retrieve/"):
    # print(f"Retrieving file: {self.path[10:]}")
    self.path = urllib.parse.unquote(self.path[9:])
    self.send_file_via_real_path()
    return
```

And for windows it must be like this:
```python
elif self.path.startswith("/retrieve/"):
    # print(f"Retrieving file: {self.path[10:]}")
    self.path = urllib.parse.unquote(self.path[10:])
    self.send_file_via_real_path()
    return
```
