Forward kinematics involves determining the position and orientation of the end-effector (the part of the robot that interacts with the environment) based on the known joint parameters (e.g., angles, lengths). The operations in this submenu include:
• Joint Number and Joint Value:
You can select a joint (e.g., joint 1) from a dropdown menu and input its value, which represents the angle (for revolute joints) or distance (for prismatic joints) of that particular joint.
Sliders are provided to adjust the values of multiple joints, giving a visual way to control joints parameters.
• Frame:
This dropdown allows you to select the frame on which to perform the forward kinematics analysis. It can be the base, the end-effector, or any intermediate frame.
• Position and Orientation:
Displays the current position (in meters) and orientation (in Euler angles, quaternions or in the form of a rotation matrix) of the selected frame wrt the world, which is updated based on the joints values.
• Find Reachable Workspace:
A feature to determine the space that the end-effector can reach given the current joints limits. The reachable workspace is the volume of space where the robot can position its end-effector, regardless of orientation.
• Joints Range Divisions:
It refers to the number of subdivisions used when calculating and plotting the reachable workspace.
• Compute and Plot:
An action button that computes the reachable workspace and displays it in a 3D plot.
