This submenu allows the user to create the workspace obstacles and the 2D plane where they are located, detect the obstacles boundaries, and save them as STL files.
- Create the Obstacles Transformation:
• 2D Plane x Length (m) / 2D Plane y Length (m): Fields to input the dimensions of the plane in meters.
• Normal Vector: Input the normal vector of the plane.
• Translation (m): Set the translation of the 2D plane in 3D space.
• Orientation (°): Specify the plane's orientation (the rotation angle around the normal vector).
• Rotation around z-axis (°) / Translation along Normal Vector (m): Sliders to adjust the plane's rotation around the z-axis and its translation along the normal vector.
• Camera-Plane z-axis Alignment: Indicates the alignment between the camera's z-axis and the plane's normal vector.
• Obstacles Transformation (w.r.t. World): Matrix showing the transformation of the obstacles in the world coordinate system.
• ArUco Pose on Plane: Options to define the "Position" and "Orientation" of the ArUco marker on the 2D plane.
- Find Singularities on Obstacles Plane:
• Tolerance / Samples: Input fields to set the tolerance and the number of samples (points divisions of the plane) for the singularities detection.
• Find Kinematic Singularities: Button to initiate the process of finding kinematic singularities for the robotic manipulator on the plane.
• Load Plane: Dropdown to select a plane configuration to load.
• Save Plane: Option to save the current plane configuration.
- Build Workspace Obstacles:
• Load Workspace Image: Dropdown to select a saved captured workspace image.
• Obstacles Saved Height (mm) / Obstacles Height (mm) for Detection: Input fields to set the obstacles' height (in millimeters) used for their detection and the one that is saved.
• Precision / Vertices Limit: Sliders to adjust the precision of the obstacles' detection and the minimum vertices number of their polygonal approximations.
• Detect Boundaries: Button to detect the boundaries (outer and inner) of the obstacles within the loaded workspace image.
• Load Obstacle Data: Dropdown to select a predefined obstacle's data.
• XY-axis resolution, Z-axis resolution: Adjust the XY-axis resolution and Z-axis resolution points for the creation of the obstacles meshes.
• Create STL file: Build an STL file for the current obstacle mesh.
• Create all STL files: Build STL files for all obstacles meshes.
