This submenu allows the user to set up and manage the serial connection between the software and the Arduino microcontroller. The elements include:
• Serial Port:
A dropdown menu to select the appropriate serial port that the Arduino is connected to on the computer.
• Baud Rate:
This dropdown allows the user to select the baud rate for the serial communication. A baud rate of 115200 bps is a common speed for such communications.
• Serial Connection State:
This indicator shows whether the software is currently connected to the Arduino microcontroller, what is the state of the robotic arm etc.
• Connect:
This button is available to establish the connection. Once clicked, the software attempts to initiate communication between the computer and the Arduino.
