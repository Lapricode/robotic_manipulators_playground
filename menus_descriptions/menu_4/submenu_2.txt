The serial monitor or console serves as the interface for sending and receiving data between the computer and the Arduino. This submenu includes:
• Main Console Area:
This large text area displays incoming data from the Arduino and any outgoing commands that have been sent. It is useful for debugging and monitoring real-time communication.
• Command Input:
This field allows the user to type in specific commands to be sent directly to the Arduino.
• Status Indicators:
Indicators labeled as "OK" and "Status" suggest the presence of a system that confirms successful command execution or displays messages about the current status of the robotic system.
• Expand submenu:
The arrow pointing upwards expands the submenu to enlarge the main console area for better visibility.
• Clear main console area:
The trash bin clears the main console of all text, providing a clean area for new messages.
• Command Starting and Ending Text:
These fields can be used to define a standard starting or ending string for the commands, potentially simplifying the command structure by automatically adding predefined text to each command sent.
• Send:
After typing a command in the input field, the user can click the "Send" button to transmit it to the Arduino microcontroller.
