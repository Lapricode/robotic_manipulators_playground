- Load the Desired Workspace Image with All the Built Obstacles:
• Workspace Image: A dropdown menu allows the user to select a workspace image.
• Plot Obstacles Boundaries: Button or option to display the boundaries of obstacles within the selected workspace image.
• Workspace Plane Transformation: Indicates that the workspace plane's transformation data will be taken from the image.
• Obstacles Infos: Displays information about the obstacles, including the number of inner and outer boundaries and the obstacles' height (30.0 mm in this case).
- Define the Start and Target Positions of the Robot's End-Effector on the Workspace Plane:
• Start Position (m) / Target Position (m): Input fields for defining the start and target positions of the robot's end-effector, initially set to [0.0, 0.0] for both.
• Position Check: A system check that validates the start and target positions. If the positions are incorrect or not defined properly, a warning (Wrong! The start and/or target positions are not defined correctly! Choose new values!) is displayed.
- Transform the Real Workspace to the Unit Disk (Radius = 1) and then Back to R2 Plane:
• Start Mapping: Button to begin the mapping process
• Real Workspace → Unit Disk: The first transformation step where the real workspace is mapped onto a unit disk. Options to build and interact with the mapping.
• Unit Disk → R2 Plane: The second step where the unit disk is transformed back to the R2 plane. Options to build and interact with this transformation.
- Apply the Control Law for the Movement of the Robotic Manipulator:
• Control Law Parameters:
k_d, k_i, w_phi, vp_max, dp_min: Fields to set various control law parameters, affecting the robot's movement dynamics.
• dt (sec): Specifies the simulation or control time step, set to 0.010 seconds.
• Max iter.: Defines the maximum number of iterations allowed for the solver, set to 500.
• Max Path Time (sec): It indicates the maximum possible travel time for the chosen path.
• Max Path Length (cm): It indicates the maximum possible travel distance for the chosen path.
• Error Tol. (cm): Sets the permissible error tolerance for the robot's movement, set to 1.0 cm.
• Error Correction: Option to enable or disable error correction during the robot's operation.
• Save Parameters / Load Parameters: Options to save the current set of parameters or load a predefined set of parameters.
• Navigation Potential Field: Plot Function / Plot Gradients, Options to visualize the potential field functions or gradients that guide the robot's movement.
• Apply Control Law: Button to apply the defined control law to the robot.
• Compute Robot Trajectory: Option to calculate the robot's trajectory based on the control law and the navigation potential field.
• Points Divisions to Plot: Specifies the number of divisions or resolution for plotting points within the workspace, set to 200.
• Move Simulated Robot: Button to initiate the movement of the simulated robot, in the canvas visualization area.
• Move Real Robot: Button to initiate the movement of the real robot, sending the proper commands through the serial connection.
